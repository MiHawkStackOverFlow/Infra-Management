# Design Principles

The following design principles would be important to consider when developing the portal:

1. Simplicity: The portal should be easy to use and navigate. Users should be able to find the information they need quickly and easily.
2. Accuracy: The portal should be accurate and up-to-date. Users should be able to trust the information they are seeing.
3. Security: The portal should be secure. Users' personal information should be protected.
4. Scalability: The portal should be scalable. It should be able to handle a large number of users and transactions.

# Features

## The following features would be helpful in the portal:

1. Task management: The portal should allow users to create and modify tasks (CRUD operation). Users should be able to assign tasks to other users and view the status of tasks.
2. Location tracking: The portal should allow users to track the location of infrastructure works. Users should be able to see where work is being done
3. Risk assessment: The portal should allow users to assess the risk of infrastructure issues. Users should be able to identify high-risk areas and take steps
4. Communication: The portal should allow users to communicate with each other. Users should be able to share information, collaborate on tasks, and resolve issues.
